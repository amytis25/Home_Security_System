# Home Invader Repellent
Written by: Amytis Saghafi, Melissa Mosavi, Richard Kim, Simon Schaufele

## PROGRAM OUTLINE
### 1 - Description
Our proposed project is a home security system designed to provide a simple and reliable solution for residential safety. The system will consist of individual door modules, each equipped with a stepper motor, an ultrasonic sensor, and a BeagleY-AI board. These modules will monitor the state of the doors and communicate with a central BeagleY-AI control unit, which interprets the data and forwards updates to the user’s personal device (e.g., phone, tablet, or laptop) via wifi connection. For the scope of this project and given hardware limitations, we will implement three door modules along with a single central control unit.
### 2 - Connectivity
Each door module would be connected to a BeagleY-AI board with networking capabilities, allowing it to communicate with a central BeagleY-AI board that communicates with the user's mobile device via a wifi connection. 
The central BeagleY-AI board will send updates to the user. <br>
**Option 1:** A Discord webhook where alerts are routed to the user through Discord
**Option 2 (if time allows):** A mobile UI that includes a control hub (e.g., sends alerts as well as allowing the user to control the lock on the door)

### Core Components

## RUNNING CMAKE
- for host:
    ```shell
        ./buildHost.sh
    ```
- for target:
    ```shell
        ./buildTarget.sh
    ```


### Manually Running CMake

To manually run CMake from the command line use:

#### Host (build for the machine you're running on)

    ```shell
    # Regenerate build/ folder and makefiles:
    rm -rf build/         # Wipes temporary build folder
    cmake -S . -B build   # Generate makefiles in build

    # Build (compile & link) the project
    cmake --build build
    ```

#### Target (cross-compile for aarch64)

Use one of these minimal options (do this from the repo root). Remove the old `build/` or `build/CMakeCache.txt` before changing compilers.

    Option A — pass compilers directly to CMake:

        ```shell
        rm -rf build/
        cmake -S . -B build \
        -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=aarch64-linux-gnu-g++
        cmake --build build
        ```

    Option B — set environment variables for a one-shot configure:

        ```shell
        rm -rf build/
        CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc CXX=aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ cmake -S . -B build
        cmake --build build
        ```
## WLAN SETUP

### SETUP
source: https://docs.beagleboard.org/boards/beagley/ai/02-quick-start.html <br><br>
Once board is fully booted and you have access to the shell, follow the commands below to connect to any WiFi access point, <br>

- To list the wireless devices attached, (you should see wlan0 listed) <br>
`iwctl device list` <br><br>
- Scan WiFi using,<br>
`iwctl station wlan0 scan`<br><br>
- Get networks using, <br>
`iwctl station wlan0 get-networks` <br><br>
- Connect to your wifi network using,<br>
`iwctl --passphrase "<wifi-pass>" station wlan0 connect "<wifi-name>"` <br><br>
- Check wlan0 status with, <br>
`iwctl station wlan0 show` <br><br>
- To list the networks with connected WiFi marked you can again use, <br>
`iwctl station wlan0 get-networks` <br><br>
- Test connection with ping command, <br>
`ping 8.8.8.8`<br>

### WLAN information
The LAN for this project is called 351network. PW defender351
Hub connected to LAN via ethernet. wlan0 of hub is connected to SFUNET-SECURE for discord message functionality

iwctl --passphrase "defender351" station wlan0 connect "351network"

to disconnect:
iwctl station wlan0 disconnect

## UDP/NETCAT INFORMATION
UDP ports used:
 - Used port 12345 on mods for hub command recieving
 - Used port 12345 on hub for command feedback from mods
 - Used port 12346 on hub for poll recieving 

NETCAT COMMANDS
netcat -u 192.168.8.108 12345 command feedback 
netcat -u 192.168.8.108 12346 or netcat -u -l -p 12346 polling to hub

netcat -u 192.168.8.213 12345 commands for D1
netcat -u 192.168.8.238 12345 commands for D2
netcat -u 192.168.9.0 12345 commands for D3
netcat -u -l -p 12345 global commands/feedback

## FRESH COMPILE
CMAKE should make 2 executables:
- door_system
- doorMod

door_system belongs on hub
doorMod runs on the doors

### Loading the Executables
Connect to HUB wifi network

Compile door_system, doorMod

run commands from executable folder (when all connected):
scp door_system melissa@192.168.8.108:/home/
scp doorMod amytis@192.168.8.213:/home/
scp doorMod simon@192.168.8.238:/home/
scp doorMod <RICHARD_USER>@192.168.0.000:/home/

Then SSH into each and run. or add to profile to auto run at startup
